Usage of functions in a labratory session of programming technics, Politecnico Di Torino
Description:
This C program defines a function f that compares two strings character by character and counts the number of matching characters. The main function utilizes this f function to compare two predefined strings and prints the count of matching characters.

The f function takes two string pointers as parameters and iterates through each character in both strings. It uses nested loops to compare characters and counts the matches, printing each matching character. The function returns the total count of matching characters.

In the main function, two string pointers (s1 and s2) are initialized with predefined strings. It then calls the f function, passing these strings, and prints the count of matching characters along with the matching characters themselves.

This program effectively demonstrates the use of functions, nested loops, character comparison, and string length calculation, making it a practical example for understanding these fundamental programming concepts in C.
